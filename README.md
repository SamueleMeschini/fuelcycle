# fuel-cycle-python
This is an open-source version of the fuel cycle model described in Meschini et al., 2023. 
The code models and simulates the various components of the fuel cycle in a nuclear fusion plant. Its primary objective is to determine the startup tritium inventory and the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) required to achieve a specified doubling time, defined as the period necessary to double the initial tritium inventory.
